desc "Change an organisation slug (DANGER!).\n

This rake task changes an organisation slug in whitehall.

It performs the following steps:
- changes org slug
- changes organisation_slug of users
- re-registers org with search
- re-registers any related editions with search

It is one part of an inter-related set of steps which must be carefully
coordinated.

    Whitehall::OrganisationSlugChanger.new(organisation, args[:new_slug], logger: logger).call
  else
    logger.error("Organisation with slug '#{args[:old_slug]}' not found")
  end
